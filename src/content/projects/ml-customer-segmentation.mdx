- **Visualization**: Interactive plots and customer journey mapping
- **Business Insights**: Actionable recommendations for each segment

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Plotly**: Interactive visualizations
- **Jupyter**: Development environment

## Results

Identified 5 distinct customer segments with 85% silhouette score, leading to 23% improvement in targeted campaign effectiveness.
